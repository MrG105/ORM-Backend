  ## Description  
  ### What was your motivation?  
    - AS A manager at an internet retail company, I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies, SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies  
  ### Why did you build this project?  
    -   To refactor code and integrate better routing and database structuring.
  ### What problem does it solve?  
```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
  ### What did you learn making this project?
